Dependencies
------------

The binaries in `bin/` have been statically linked and can run without dependencies on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. If you wish to re-build from source, the following are needed.

- C compiler (gcc)
- 32-bit libc

On Ubuntu 12.04, all the dependencies can be installed with `sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib libc6-i386 libc6-dev-i386`
